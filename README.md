This is s copy of the once famous game "Flappy Bird" programmed for TTGO-t1 display using the tft_eSPI library provided by Bodmer.
I'm not a programmer, the code could be optimized 1M times but it was just for fun. To convert the images i used ImageConverter (UTFT) 
on the Rinky-Dink Electronics websit. The project was made through PlatformIO so you should be able to try it if you have the same board and VSCode.
